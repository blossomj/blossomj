 <p> <h2> This Week's Project </h2>
  </p>
<p>  The first sticker I made was a corgi sticker. I found several images to use, one of which featured a dog on grass, but quickly discovered that selecting an image with a white background would be a much more efficient use of my time. Next, I had to make a black and white sticker to print from the Roland and weed. I decided to create a label for my english folder, which I created on Google Docs on my laptop, then used Paint to convert the screenshot from a png to a jpg. Because I did this during study hours, I was able to spend less class time on the design, and more on the execution. </p>
