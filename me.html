  <p> <h1> About Me</h1>
</p>
  
  
 <p> I am a four-year senior from Chagrin Falls. I have an older sister and three dogs. I am an ice-cream enthusiast (particularly of Mitchell's) and a loyal fan of all Cleveland sports. This fall I was a field hockey captain, and this spring will be my sixth season playing lacrosse. I have always been interested in digital fabrication, and this interest has increased as I have begun to familiarize myself with it. At first, code can appear to be very intimidating. But one day over the summer, I signed up for Code Academy on a whim, and began typing. Although I only have completed 30% of the intorduction to HTML, I am much more comfortable having grasped the absolute basics. My interest in CAD has always been a part of me, but I never knew how to begin understanding it. I took several classes at Brown this summer, including introduction to engineering, and a CAD class. After two weeks, I found myself feeling very excited to take these new-found tools home with me.
