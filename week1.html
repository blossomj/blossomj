  <p> <h1> Week 1 </h1>
</p>
  
 <p> <h2> The Project </h2>
  </p>
<p> My group approached the challenge which entailed building the tallest possible tower of newspaper and 18 inches of tape while withstanding the power of a fan. My group utilized two sheets of newspaper to create an aero dynamic base in the shape of a triangle. The tower was secured to the corner nearest the fan</p>

 <p> <h3> My Contributions </h3>
  </p>
<p> Personally, with some help from Nate, I created the top part of the tower, and tried to maximize the extension while using as little tape as possible without hindering the structural integrity of the tower. I knew that a cone/ cylinder shape would facilitate the group's goals.</p>
