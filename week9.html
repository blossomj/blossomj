 <p> <h2> This Week's Project </h2>
  </p>
<p>  Although I knew the wires didn't have to be the same color as the examples showed, I decided to keep them pretty similar to make the troubleshooting process easier if I thought I had forgotten to make a connection. 4A was the biggest struggle for me, and I couldn't get the LED board to show "Hello World". When I was trying to find my error I referred back to the instructions and double checked each connection. Next, I switched everything over to a different Red Board, then tried a different LED panel. Although I was able to make the LED board produce light on the side, I was unable to make it function properly. I would guess that my problem was with the USB cable connecting my computer to the Red Board, or with the uploading process from the Arduino program to the Red Board. After spending lots of time on 4a, we had the bring your kid to work day. I believe with one more day I would've finished all of the different sections. </p>
