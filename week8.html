  <p> <h1> Week 8- Soldiering and Electronics </h1>
</p>
  
 <p> <h2> This Week's Project </h2>
  </p>
<p>  I have soldered once before, but it was in 8th grade. I felt that my soldering itslef was pretty good, but that it took me longer than many of my classmates. As a result, I only got around to electronics with 5 minutes remaining in the last class. </p>

<p> As you can see in the second image, I used too much solder on one of the connections, which made the pads touch. Unfortunately, by the time I was able to separate the the two, the iron had been on the circuit board for too long. While I can't find the picture of my heart, this one went pretty well for me. I wasn't able to get the heart to light up either. The day I did the heart ciruit board, I was using an older iron so the solder would take a few extra seconds to melt. While waiting for the solder to melt, I think I may have rested the tip on the board, which could have fried the board. </p>
